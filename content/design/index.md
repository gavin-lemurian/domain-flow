# Elements of Good Design

For sixty years, we have been optimizing for sequential computation. The best algorithms
for sequential execution are those that minimize the number of operations to yield results. 
Computational complexity theory is well-aligned with this quest, but any
performance-minded algorithm designer knows that the best theoretical algorithms are 
not necessarily the fastest when executed on real hardware. The difference is typically
caused by the trade-off sequential algorithms have to make between computation and
accessing memory. 

This chapter explores the elements of good design for parallel algorithms and their
execution on real hardware.
