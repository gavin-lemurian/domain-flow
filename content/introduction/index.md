### Introduction

# Introduction to Domain Flow Algorithms

Domain Flow algorithms are parallel algorithms that incorporate the constraints of space and time.
By honoring the delay that is inherent to the operation of information exchange between two physically
separate computation or storage sites, domain flow algorithms can improve performance, and most
importantly, lower energy consumption, as compared to computational models that are based on sequential
execution.

These benefits are particularly important for embedded, real-time applications, such as computer vision,
sensor fusion, and in general, autonomous intelligent systems.
