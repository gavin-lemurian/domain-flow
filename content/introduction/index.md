# Introduction to Domain Flow Algorithms

Domain Flow algorithms are parallel algorithms that incorporate the constraints of space and time.
By honoring the delay that is inherent to exchanging information between two physically
separate computation or storage sites, domain flow algorithms can improve energy efficiency
compared to sequential execution models represented by multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs.

Low-latency, energy-efficient computation is particularly important for the emerging application
class of autonomous intelligent systems.
