Basic Linear Algebra Routines are an historical significant set of
functions that encapsulate the basic building blocks of a large collection
of linear algebra algorithms and implementation.

The BLAS library has been a mechanism to create highly optimized
numerical libraries to a plethora of computer architectures and machines.
